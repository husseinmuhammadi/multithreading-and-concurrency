## Thread Fundamentals

###  Join 
[Java Thread Join Example](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/java-thread-join-example)

If the thread is interrupted, it throws InterruptedException.

## Monitoring 
### SIMULATE THREAD DEADLOCK
Start the project and let it simulate thread deadlock, each thread will stop for the other thread, to determine what the thread lock is
